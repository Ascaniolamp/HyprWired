This script will install every single configuration file,<br>
so if you're looking to download only one theme,<br>
please do so manually by following the script's directories.<br>

This is actually a [winamp skin](https://skins.webamp.org/skin/9b108abe36d37b230909ea49ffc09ed4/lainampborders.zip)

# Firefox
![](./src/dotfiles/firefox.gif)

I'm sorry, but you'll have to set this one up manually.

1. Follow [this tutorial](https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html) on how to set up your chrome.<br>
Instead of making a new folder, just copy [this one](./src/chrome) into your profile directory.

This is the content of `~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini` file:<br>
```
	[InstallSOMECODE]
	Default=PROFILECODE.default-release
```
While this is the `~/.mozilla/firefox/installs.ini` file:<br>
```
	[SOMECODE]
	Default=PROFILECODE.default-release
```
These might be useful to automate the process into the installation script somehow.

2. These are the contrast control options (which I usually keep turned off,<br>
as most pages don't display properly with contrast control):<br>
```
text:				#CE7688		[foreprimary]
background:			#000000		[backprimary]
unvisited_links:	#C1B48E		[highprimary]
visited_links:		#968C6E		[highquaternary]
```

3. Now you'll just need to install [lain theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lain-theme)
by [Ale Kesadillas](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17990245) to complete your firefox customization!

# Aliases
There are a number of aliased commands in `.profile`,<br>
they aren't needed for the themes' correct functioning,<br>
they're optional and can be freely removed.
