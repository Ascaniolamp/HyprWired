## [‚ÄºÔ∏èüö®‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏èüö®‚ÄºÔ∏è](../../README.md)
The installation also includes `oh-my-zsh`,
which is not listed in any of the `*pkgs.lst` files.

## Credits
[Most graphics come from **fauux**'s website.](../../README.md#fauux)
Some SFX come from Lain's OST, which was [archived](https://archive.org/details/sukidesuost-lain) by **sukidesuost**.

I slightly modified someone else's neofetch configuration,
so please [send me](mailto:ascaniolamp@gmail.com) the original project's link!

This config just changes the default powerlevel10k OS icon.
The [actual theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) is not included in the installation,
you're going to have to install it yourself.

## Extra
Some more stuff I found while working on the project
which you may find interesting or useful
if you'd like to work on your own version!
