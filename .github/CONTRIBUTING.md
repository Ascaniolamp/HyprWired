# Introduction
Thank you for even just considering contributing to this project,
both you and I know this project really needs some improvement.
I'm using the term "improvement" here with the widest range of meanings possible,
because **any** contribution, however small or seemingly insignificant, helps a lot.
*You* are part of (and [make](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803134036/http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia)) the community.
There are hundreds of ways you can improve this project, and you should!

# Contributing
Don't be scared to use the issue tracker for issues or requests that may seem trivial;
Being at the start of this project, any criticisms or complaints are much appreciated,
and I'm happy to give all the help _I can_ to people who might want to use it.<br>
<sup>
Filing issues isn't limited to any Linux distro or WM,
but the project is mainly targeted at Arch Linux + Hyprland systems,
so don't expect much support if you're running anything else.
</sup>

When filing an issue, please provide as much relevant information as possible:<br>
- Your device's hardware and software information
- The version of the software you're having trouble with you're using
- What you did, the expected outcome and the actual result

If you believe you can help improve this project but don't know how to do so,

# Rules
If you've already set your mind on contributing to the project,
I wouldn't want to steer you away just now,
but I really need you to read the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
before you're going to interact with other users.

Please keep in mind the principles and rules I've set for this project:

## Transparency
If you'd like to add or remove a functionality,
please think of how it may affect the project at large
and if everyone is going to want that change on their system.
If you don't think that's the case,
you should either make that functionality optional
or discuss it in an issue to get community feedback.

## Honesty
**ALWAYS** give proper credit for anyone else's work.
It can be code, assets or any other type of content.
Before adding someone else's content to the project:
ask the creator/owner for permission to distribute it, its license, etc.

## Target
This project has not intention of being a cross-platform beast.
However, please refrain from adding solutions that only work on your system,
and ensure they work correctly at least on an Arch Linux Hyprland installation.

## Freedom
Avoid including proprietary software in the project.
Always strive for [free/libre](https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) alternatives.

## Clarity
I'm not asking you to commit perfectly clean code, but if there is one,
please adhere to the project's common practices
for things such as style, casing, directory structure, etc.
This makes it easier for everyone to start and continue contributing,
and constitutes a big difference in the project's lifespan.
