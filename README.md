## <div align="center" id="Disclaimer">‚ÄºÔ∏è üö® ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è üö® ‚ÄºÔ∏è</div>
This started off and was supposed to be my personal rice.
When I'd finished working on it, I thought others may like it,
so I decided to share it to the public.
That's why I was careless about tracking any credits or sources
(a bona fide mistake which I tried to make up to as much as possible).
Therefore, even though all submodules in this repo are distributed under the GPLv3.0 license,
the ones with a `LICENSE` file in their folder are excluded (ex. spotify, vesktop).
I also do not own **any** of the rights to the graphics and audio assets used (see ["Credits"](.#Credits)).

Because of the same reason, **nothing** in this project is made to be professional nor elegant.
I highly reccomend you either check (and maybe even modify) the installation
scripts or just avoid them completely, as they could possibly be destructive
in regards to your old configuration files.
Only use the `--no-preserve` option if you know what you're doing
and have already backed up your previous configuration files.
If any problems arise after running the scripts, replace the new configuration
files with the old, backed up ones (ending in `.hyprlainbak`).
By reviewing the scripts, you'll easily find the directories that are utilized,
so that you can manually install the configuration files yourself.
With this being said, if you're on a freshly-installed system, they shouldn't
be destructive (as you might not have many dotfiles yet).

## <div align="center" id="Notes"> ‚ùó Important Notes ‚ùó </div>
- Various repositories are included in the installation scripts.
	If you wish to review them, they're listed in each submodule's `aurpkgs.lst` and `pacpkgs.lst` files
	(some may have more listed in their READMEs).
- Most submodules will require the [Adwaita Mono Nerd Font](https://github.com/nazmulidris/adwaita-mono-nerd-font) to be installed.
- When applying a theme in nwg-look (by clicking the GUI "apply" button),
	the .config/assets folder will automatically be deleted.
	This is because of nwg-look, it doesn't have anything to do with me!

## <div align="center" id="Install"> üì• üñ•Ô∏è Install üñ•Ô∏è üì• </div>
Hyprlain was configured and tested on a machine running **Hyprland** on **Arch Linux**,
so I can guarantee you it'll work on such an installation.
If it doesn't, [open an issue](https://github.com/Ascaniolamp/Hyprlain/issues)
after checking you followed all the installation instructions correctly.

The configurations should, AFAIK, work regardless of what distro you're running.
All of them have been specifically configured with wayland in mind,
so if you're trying to install them on an X11 DE, you might want to check their options.

- **Arch Linux**: You can either [run the installation scripts](.#Scripts) or follow the [manual installation](.#Manual).
- **Other distros**: Only [manual installation](.#Manual) is currently supported.

### Scripts
<div align="center">
<strong>‚ö†Ô∏è <a href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay">YAY</a> IS REQUIRED TO INSTALL AUR PACKAGES VIA THE INSTALL SCRIPTS ‚ö†Ô∏è</strong><br>
<strong><sup>IF YOU'D RATHER USE ANOTHER AUR HELPER, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MODIFY THE HELPER SCRIPT</sup></strong>
</div>

If you only want to download a single theme or configuration,
each submodule's folder should contain its individual `install.sh` script,
which will require you download and put the `helper.sh` script in its parent directory to work.
This is what the directory tree should look like:
```
PARENT
	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helper.sh
	‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hyprland
		‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install.sh
		‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
```

### Manual
You could try modifying the `helper.sh` script's `downdependencies` function
to fit your distro's package manager.
I actually encourage you do so and share the modified script,
as it may come in handy to other people.
<sup>It's a really quick and easy fix that anyone with some basic bash knowledge can do.</sup>
<sup>I could do it myself, but I don't feel the necessity to do so right now.</sup>

Otherwise, each `install.sh` script indicates the installation process:

1. Install the [Adwaita Mono Nerd Font](https://github.com/nazmulidris/adwaita-mono-nerd-font).
2. Check the install script of every module you want to download for instructions:
	1. Download the packages listed in `pacpkgs.lst` and `aurpkgs.lst`
	2. The `substitute` function's first argument contains the path in which the second argument file should go.
		Substitute these files manually (with the right precautions).
3. Restart your device (optional, but the changes won't have any effect until you do).

This isn't a super in-depth guide made for beginners,
I count on your bash knowledge and my code's readability and simplicity.
This is the case for `sh` commands (which will require you to execute them)
or lines which will require you to modify the content of the treated files.

If you're able to do so, please [send them a donation](https://paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=EED5LRPSLVP4Q), they really deserve it!

## TODO
- [ ] Replace GTK's adwaita with a custom theme
- [ ] Add gtkshowcase.png
- [ ] Add releases
- [ ] Check for TODO
- [ ] Submodules to kbd buttons
- [ ] Better READMEs!
	- Emojis
	- Cards/badges/shields
	- Special files/paths

For now, [y]our only hope is that somebody else (with the right time and knowledge)
will come along and contribute to this project.
If you think you're that person, please do try!
